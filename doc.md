# Decent Messaging API Documentation

| Version       | Released        |
|:-------------:| --------------- |
|               | Not yet         |

**This document acts as a user guide to the public APIs of Decent servers as
defined by [the specification](spec.md). If you are writing a server
implementation, please refer to that document also.**

---

Servers support the following two forms of transport, which are meant to be used in conjunction with eachother:

#### HTTP(S) endpoints - For client->server requests

The HTTP API is accessed via `/api/`. All endpoints respond in JSON, and those which take request bodies expect it to also be formatted using JSON. Server implementors may choose an appropriate HTTP status code for responses, however this must not be relied on by clients.

#### WebSocket events - For server->client event notifications

Messages sent to and from sockets are JSON strings, following the format `{ evt, data }`, where `evt` is a name representing the meaning of the event, and `data` is an optional property specifying any additional data related to the event.

---

## Authentication

Clients should authenticate using both of the following methods at the same time.

<details><summary><b>With HTTP(S)</b> - per-request</summary>

When a request is made to an API endpoint, the server searches for a [session ID](#sessions) string given in the request using **one** of:

* `?sessionID` in query string (URL)
* `sessionID` in request body
* `X-Session-ID` header (**recommended**)

Note that if session IDs are provided more than once in a single request the request will [error](#errors) with REPEATED_PARAMETERS.

If a session ID is provided but invalid/expired, the request is immediately terminated with an INVALID_SESSION_ID [error](#errors).

If the request requires [permission(s)](#permissions) and a session ID is not provided or its user does not posses the expected permissions, the request is terminated with a NOT_ALLOWED [error](#errors).

Note that "you" in this document typically refers to the provided session ID's related user.

</details>

<details><summary><b>With WebSockets</b> - ping/pong periodically</summary>

## pingdata

Sent periodically (typically every 10 seconds) by the server, as well as immediately upon the client socket connecting. Clients should respond with a `pongdata` event, as described below. No `data` is sent with the event.

## pongdata

Should be **sent from clients** (unlike all other WebSocket transmissions) in response to `pingdata`. Notifies the server of any information related to the particular socket. Passed data should include:

* `sessionID`, if the client is "logged in" or keeping track of a session ID. This is used for keeping track of which users are online.
  - Note `null` means 'not logged in'.

</details>

## Errors

Nearly all HTTP endpoints return errors situationally. Generally, when the processing of a request errors, its response will have the `error` property, which will follow the form `{ code, message }`. Server implementors may optionally include extra infomation in this return map, using any key other than `code` or `message`.

The `message` property is a string of a human-readable English message briefly explaining what went wrong, and the `code` is a permanent identifier string for the type of error that happened. Checking `code` is useful for displaying custom messages or behavior when particular errors occur.

<details><summary><b>Error codes</b></summary>

| Error code             | Meaning                                             |
| ----------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------|
| NOT_FOUND              | The requested thing was not found                   |
| NOT_YOURS              | Your attempt to do something impactful was rejected because you are not the owner/author of the thing |
| MISSING_PERMISSION     | You do not have a required permission               |
| NO                     | The server does not support or does not want to fulfill your request |
| ALREADY_PERFORMED      | That action has already been performed              |
| FAILED                 | Something went wrong internally                     |
| INCOMPLETE_PARAMETERS  | A property is missing from the request's parameters |
| REPEATED_PARAMETERS    | A parameter is specified twice in the request       |
| INVALID_PARAMETER_TYPE | A parameter is the wrong type                       |
| INVALID_SESSION_ID     | There is no session with the provided session ID    |
| INVALID_NAME           | Provided [name](#name) is invalid                   |
| NAME_ALREADY_TAKEN     | The passed name is already used by something else   |
| SHORT_PASSWORD         | Password is too short                               |
| INCORRECT_PASSWORD     | Incorrect password                                  |

</details>

## Permissions

Permissions in Decent are a way to limit and grant certain abilities to users.

<details><summary><b>How permissions work</b></summary>

Permissions are stored within a map of keys (representing individual permissions) to boolean values (or undefined). For example, the following permissions object describes being able to read but not send messages:

```js
{
  "readMessages": true,
  "sendMessages": false
}
```

Individual permissions are passed according to a cascade of roles. If two or more permission objects are applied (typically based on the roles a user has), then individual permissions are determined by the most prioritized roles. For example, consider these three permission objects:

```js
{
  "sendMessages": false
}

{
  "readMessages": true,
  "sendMessages": true
}

{
  "readMessages": false,
  "sendMessages": false
}
```

Suppose we consider the first, top-most object to have the greatest priority, and that the second and third each in turn have less priority.

If all three permission objects are applied to a user, then to calculate the user's permissions, we start by looking at the most prioritized object. This object contains one property, `sendMessages: false`. From this, we know that the user is not permitted to send messages; this is absolutely true, regardless of any other permission objects, since this object is the most prioritized one.

Then we move to the next permission object: `{readMessages: true, sendMessages: true}`. The `readMessages: true` permission tells us that the user is allowed to read messages. There is also a `sendMessages` property, but we ignore this, since we have already determined that the user is not permitted to send messages.

We look at the final permission object: `{readMessages: false, sendMessages: false}`. There are two properties here, but these have both already been determined earlier, so we ignore them. Since we have gone through all permission objects applied to the user, we come to the conclusion that **the user may read but not send messages.**

The actual priority of permission objects is determined according to the roles applied to the user and channel-specific permissions (which are dependent on the roles), and the order is determined as follows:

* Channel-specific permissions for roles of the user (First.)
* Channel-specific permissions for the `_user` role, if the user is a logged-in member of the server
* Channel-specific permissions for the `_everyone` role
* Server-wide permissions for roles of the user
* Server-wide permissions for the `_user` role (if applicable, as above)
* Server-wide permissions for the `_everyone` role (Last.)

Permissions for roles of the user (both globally and channel-specific) are prioritized according to the [role prioritization order](#prioritize-roles). Note that the order of the user's `roles` property **does not** have any effect on the order roles that are applied when calculating their perissions.

</details>

<details><summary><b>Table of permissions</b></summary>

A set of permissions can be configured for different [roles](#roles). When these roles are attached to users, they grant or revoke specific privileges within the entire server.

Below is a table of all permissions.

| Code              | Description                                              |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `manageServer`    | Allows changes to [server settings](#settings).          |
| `manageUsers`     | Allows for updating of users other than yourself, and allows deletion of users. |
| `manageRoles`     | Allows creation/deletion/modification/granting/revoking of [roles](#roles) under you. |
| `manageChannels`  | Allows management and editing of [channels](#channels) and their permissions. |
| `managePins`      | Allows for [pinning](#pin) and [unpinning](#unpin) of messages. |
| `manageEmotes`    | Allows for creation and removal of [emotes](#emotes).    |
| `readMessages`    | Allows for viewing of channel [messages](#messages); if false, the channel does not show up in the channel list. |
| `sendMessages`    | Allows for [sending messages](#send-message).            |
| `deleteMessages`  | Allows for [deleting messages](#delete-message) that you did not author. |
| `sendSystemMessages` | Allows for [sending system messages](#send-message).  |
| `uploadImages`    | Allows [image uploads](#upload-image).                   |
| `allowNonUnique`  | Allows the creation of things with non-unique [names](#names). |

## Miscellaneous

**Endpoints**

###### Retrieve server implementation details [GET /api]
Returns `{ decentVersion, implementation, useSecureProtocol }`, where `decentVersion` is a string version number corresponding to the specification version the server supports/providers, `implementation` is a string typically refering to the name of the server impementation, and the boolean `useSecureProtocol` should be `true` when this server is only accessible via the _HTTPS_ and _WSS_ protocols.

Should be used to check to see if a particular server is compatible with the version of the spec that you (the client) support. Note that Decent follows [SemVer](https://semver.org/), so unless the MAJOR (first) portion of the version number is different to what you expect communication should work fine.

```js

## Messages

```js
{
  "id": ID,
  "channelID": ID,

  // The message type. See below
  "type": string,

  // The content of the message
  "text": string,

  // The author's details, at the time of creation;
  // if message.type = "system" these will all be null.
  "authorID": ID,
  "authorUsername": Name,
  "authorAvatarURL": string,

  // Dates are returned as the number of seconds since UTC 1970-1-1, commonly
  // known as Unix time. May be more accurate using decimal places.
  "dateCreated": float,
  "dateEdited": float | null,

  "pinned": boolean,
  "mentionedUserIDs": [ ID ]
}
```

#### Message types

There are currently two message types, `"user"` and `"system"`. Messages sent by users are always marked `"user"`, however both the server and users with the `sendSystemMessage` [permission](#permissions). can choose to send system-level messages for things, such as user joins or when pins are added. Ideally, these would be styled differently in clients.

System messages lack `author` fields.

#### Mentions

Mentions target a single user only and are formatted as `<@userID>`, where `userID` is the ID of the user who is being mentioned. Mentions are stored per-user on the server. `mentionedUserIDs` is derived from the content of the message.

**Events**

<a name='message-new'></a>
###### message/new

Sent to all clients whenever a message is [sent](#send-message) to any channel in the server. Passed data is in the format `{ message }`, where `message` is a [message](#messages) representing the new message.

Sent to all clients when any message is [edited](#edit-message). Passed data is in the format `{ message }`, where `message` is a [message](#messages) representing the new message.

<a name='message-delete'></a>
###### message/delete

<-   }
<- }
```

<a name='edit-message'></a>
###### Edit a message [PATCH /api/messages/:id]

-> }

<- {}
```

This endpoint will return a NOT_YOURS [error](#errors) if you do not own the message in question. Emits [user/mentions/add](#user-mentions-add) to newly [mentioned](#mentions) users and [user/mentions/remove](#user-mentions-remove) to users who are no longer mentioned, if any.

<a name='delete-message'></a>
###### Delete a message [DELETE /api/messages/:id]
+ requires one of:
  * session with ownership of message `id`
  * [permission](#permissions) (for channel of specified message) `deleteMessages`
+ **in-url** id (ID) - The ID of the message to delete

Emits [message/delete](#message-delete) and returns `{}`.

```js
DELETE /api/messages/1234

<- {}
```

This endpoint may return a NOT_YOURS [error](#errors) if you do not own the message in question. Note that admins may delete any message. Emits [user/mentions/remove](#user-mentions-remove) to all previously-[mentioned](#mentions) users.

```

<a name='get-messages-in-channel'></a>
###### Get messages in channel [GET /api/channels/:id/messages]
+ requires [permission](#permissions) (for specified channel) `readMessages`
+ **in-url** id (ID) - The ID of the channel to fetch messages of.
+ `before` (ID; optional) - The ID of the message right **after** the range of messages you want.
+ `after` (ID; optional) - The ID of the message right **before** the range of messages you want.
+ `limit` (integer; optional, default `50`) - The maximum number of messages to fetch. Must be `1 <= limit <= 50`.

Returns `{ messages }`, where messages is an array of the most recent [messages](#messages) sent to this channel. If `limit` is given, it'll only fetch that many messages.

If `before` is specified, it'll only return messages sent before that one; and it'll only return messages sent after `after`.

```js
GET /api/channels/5678/messages

<- {
<-   "messages": [
<-     {
<-       "id": "1234",
<-       "channelID": "5678",
<-       // ...
<-     },
<-     {
<-       "id": "1235",
<-       "channelID": "5678",
<-       // ...
<-     }
<-   ]
<- }
```

```js
GET /api/channels/5678/messages?after=1234

<- {
<-   "messages": [
<-     {
<-       "id": "1235",

```

<a name='update-channel-permissions'></a>
###### Update channel-specific role permissions [PATCH /api/channels/:id/role-permissions]
+ requires [permission](#permissions) (for specified channel) `manageRoles`
+ **in-url** id (ID)
+ **rolePermissions** - an object map of role IDs to their permissions

Returns `{}` if successful. Note that if a role is not specified on the **roles** parameter, its permissions on the channel will not be changed. To delete an entry, pass `{}` as the role's permissions; since this would reset the role's permissions all to unset, the role would have no effect, and is removed from the channel's `rolePermissions` map.
