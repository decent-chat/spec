This repository contains [the server specification](spec.md) and [API documentation](doc.md) for Decent servers.

* **If you're writing a custom server**, see [spec.md](spec.md) and the latter part of [doc.md](doc.md#api).
* **If you're an API consumer or are writing a client**, check out [doc.md](doc.md).
* **If you have a feature idea**, [create an issue](https://github.com/decent-chat/spec/issues/new).

Both of these documents adhere to SemVer, and we use [Releases](https://github.com/decent-chat/spec/releases).
